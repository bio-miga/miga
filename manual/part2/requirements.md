# Requirements

MiGA requires a system (single computer, cluster, or cloud-computing
infrastructure) with Linux or MacOS. If you simply want to access projects
previously processed, all you need is `ruby` 2.7+ and the `miga-base` gem.
If you want to use MiGA to process your data, please follow these instructions.

MiGA has a relatively long list of requirements, but most of them are easy to
install. Find your system below and follow the instructions using:

* [Homebrew](requirements/brew.md) (preferred),
* [`apt-get`](requirements/apt-get.md),
* [Anaconda](requirements/conda.md),
* [Installing from source](requirements/source.md).

Additionally you will need [MyTaxa utils](requirements/mytaxa.md)
in order to activate the [MyTaxa](../part5/workflow.md#mytaxa) and
[MyTaxa Scan](../part5/workflow.md#mytaxa-scan) steps (optional).
